APP	"cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cytosolic phospholipase, interleukin-1(IL-1), and the -amyloid precursor protein of proinflammatory and neurodegenerative gene were found to be upregulated in the American Tissue Culture Collection of glioma and glioblastoma. Therefore, increasing _APP and proinflammatory expression in glioma and glioblastoma would understand APP–COX-2–CPL–IL-1 signaling and provide a therapeutic strategy.

"GPD2,NDUFA13"	"When patients were stratified by low versus high GPD2 pT10 levels, patient survival was better with lower GPD2 pT10 levels (Figure 6C). When patients were stratified by tumor grade, patient_derived grade IV tumors exhibited higher levels of GPD2 pT10 (but not GPD2 levels) compared to grade I/II tumors (Figure 6D). This analysis of patient_derived tumors demonstrates the clinical significance of GPD2 pT10, whose elevated levels correlated with unfavorable patient outcomes and higher tumor grade."
